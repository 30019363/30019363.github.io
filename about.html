								<p>Hello, my name is Joshua Kim. I am currently a student studying at the University of Calgary
                                    and graduating in December 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Skills</h3>
                                    <p> My primary skills I have to offer are all skills that I learned and developed while pursuing my degree. 
                                        The skills that I am most confident in are: 
										<div class="table-wrapper">
											<table class="alt">
												<thead>
													<tr>
														<th>Name</th>
														<th>Description</th>
													</tr>
												</thead>
												<tbody>
													<tr>
														<td>Java</td>
														<td>Java was the first programming language I learned and also one of the languages I used the most throughout university.
                                                            I have also taken a course that taught better practices and techniques when coding in Java, such as refactoring. 
                                                            This has lead to Java being my most studied and comfortable language. 
                                                        </td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>C++</td>
														<td>Like Java, C++ was one of my most used languages during university. For one of my classes assignments we were asked to optimize
                                                            algorithms using C++. This lead to me learning C++ in much more detail as well as becoming much more comfortable programming in C++.  
                                                        </td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Self Learning</td>
														<td> As I have self taught myself every language I know except for Java, I am quite confident in my ability to teach myself a new language. 
                                                            While I was learning code optimization with C++, I also picked up quite a few good methods that help when learning either a new language or expanding
                                                            my knowledge of a language I already know. 
                                                        </td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Python</td>
														<td>This is a language I have used frequently in various courses such as cryptography and introductory machine learning. While learning this language I found it quite intuitive to use and very convenient. 
                                                         </td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>HTML/CSS</td>
														<td>HTML and CSS are both languages I have used to create a handful of websites. </td>
													</tr>
                                                    <tr>
														<td>JavaScript</td>
														<td>Through the creation of several basic websites and the Wordle Battle project I have become quite familiar with how JavaScript works and how it interacts with HTML. Also, most of
                                                            my work with JavaScript has been in tandem with js libraries such as Node.js. </td>
													</tr>
                                                    <tr>
														<td>Databases</td>
														<td>Through the creation of the library database I understand the basics of how to create a database. Furthermore, I also learned how to
                                                            process the HTTP request from the front-end to interact with the database. </td>
													</tr>
                                                    <tr>
														<td>C#</td>
														<td>C# is a language that, similar to JavaScript and Python, was quite intuitive making it very quick to learn and easy to use. </tr>
