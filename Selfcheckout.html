								<h2>Self-Checkout System</h2>
								<p>For this project I helped develop the software portion of a grocery stores self-checkout system. The project was built using Java and Java Swing.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>
									<p>The goal of this project was to create the software portion of a self-checkout system that can often be found at a grocery store. 
										The hardware of the self-checkout machine was simulated using software and was created by professor Robert James Walker at the University of Calgary.
									</p>
									<p> The software portion would handle the inputs provided by the hardware portion of the machine, like scanning an item or processing payment. For example, if an item is scanned then the total cost would update 
										and the machine would lock until the item is placed in the bagging area. The entire machine was represented using a GUI created with Java Swing.

									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> The action menu in this image serves to simulate the customer with their cart full of groceries.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p> When first launching the program, the self-checkout machine starts in a locked state. To unlock the machine a staff member must log in and turn the machine on.</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>Below is an image of the staff members UI. At the bottom left of the menu there is a button to turn the station on, which will allow customers to access the machine. 
										Furthermore, for any hardware maintenance the system must first be blocked via the Block System button. 
									</p> 
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> This screen shows the window that will welcome the customer ready to checkout. </p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> As mentioned above, the customers actions are handled by the action menu, and all the products added to the transaction will be listed on the left.
										When items are scanned they must be placed in the bagging area otherwise the system will lock due to the weight in the bagging area not matching the expected weight.
									</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> The search bar on the right is to search for an item that needs to be weighed and added manually, such as produce.</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self5.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> This screen indicates that the customer is adding their bags to the bagging area. This is so the system does not lock due to unexpected weight in the bagging area.</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/selff6.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p> The following two images show as the customer is ready to checkout. </p> 
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self7.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/self8.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
