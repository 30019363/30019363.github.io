									<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>
									<p> Wordle Battle is a word game where players have six tries to try to guess a random 5-letter word. After each guess the player will receive a hint to help them towards their next guess.
										 The hint will change the color of the tiles, where yellow indicates that the letter inside the tile is correct but in the wrong position, green indicates a perfect match, and gray 
										 means that the word does not contain that letter. The difference between Wordle Battle and Wordle is that this version has players compete and race against each other to see who can 
										guess the word first.   <br><br>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>The Wordle Battle application consists of two windows, a window to join a game room and the window where the game is played. When opening the website, users are prompted to create a username and enter a room code. <br>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/image3.png" alt="" /></span></div></p>
									<p> The username must be unique from any other username in the room that the user is trying to join. For the room code, if the code entered does not exist then a new room will be
										created with that code. If the room does exist then the user will join that room with the entered username. If no username is entered a guest username will be given.
									</p> 
									<p> After entering a room, the user can start playing. As mentioned above the objective of the game is to guess a random 5-letter word within six tries, with each attempt providing a hint to the player. 
										While attempting to guess the answer, on the left hand side of the screen there is a list of all the other users in the room. Under each username there are 5 colored blocks indicating that players most recent guess.
										And beside each username there will be a star followed by a number, this number indicates the number of wins each player in the room has.  </p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/image13.png" alt="" /></span></div></p>
									<p>Players must guess a real 5-letter word or the guess is not accepted. As seen in the images below an error pop-up created by Bootstrap will show up telling the player what went wrong. </p>
									<div class="box alt">

											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/image15.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div> 
									<p> Once a player manages to guess the correct word a victory pop-up shows up for all players in the room. If a player presses OK, then the game will restart with a random new 5-letter word and the number of wins beside the 
										winners username will update for all users to see.
